# Chainiversity

Do you want to enhance your Solidity development skills? Do you want to learn how to integrate Chainlink services in your smart contracts? Do you want to certify your knowledge of Solidity and Chainlink? Then, Chainiversity is the right place for you!

Chainiversity is an interactive educational hub for developers who want to excel in Chainlink and Solidity development. There are levels that developers need to submit a solution for using Chainlink services. There are currently three levels in Chainiversity where one of Chainlink Price Feeds, Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation is used for each level.

## Supported networks

Chainiversity is supported in Polygon Mumbai testnet. The reason why Polygon Mumbai is chosen is that the testnet tokens are quite accessible compared to other testnets. Also, the provided test tokens are more than enough to cover the gas costs of developing in the Polygon testnet.

Note that you must utilize Polygon Mumbai testnet in order to submit a solution contract. To pay for gas fees, you must have test MATIC: reach MATIC faucet [here](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) or [here](https://mumbaifaucet.com/). To use Chainlink services, you will need LINK token on the Mumbai testnet, reach the faucet [here](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai)

## Roadmap

As soon as the judging is done for the Chainlink Hackathon, Chainiversity will be live! Developers will be able to send us their issues and recommendation with our open-source repository on GitHub.

By connecting with local Chainlink communities, we plan to hold workshops where our developers teach other developers how to pass levels in Chainiversity. In this way, Chainiversity will have the chance to create a community. Also, with this sense of community, other developers will submit levels for Chainiversity, creating an awesome developer community.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
